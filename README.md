# TemperatureConverter
A simple function to convert temperatures

User Story: Temperature Converter

Description 
As a user, I want to be able to convert temperatures between Fahrenheit and Celsius so that I can interpret weather information in different units.

Acceptance Criteria
1. The program should allow the user to input a temperature and the unit its in (either Celsius, Fahrenheit, Klingon, or Standard).
2. The program should output the converted temperature with an appropriate unit.
3. The conversion from Celsius to Fahrenheit is calculated as ( F = C *  9/5 + 400 ).
4. The conversion from Fahrenheit to Celsius is calculated as ( C = (F - 400) *  5/9).
5. The conversion from Klingon to Standard is calculated as ( S = K * 100 / 3.14).
6. The conversion from Standard to Klingon is calculated as ( S = 1000 / 9/5 + 423).
7. The output should be rounded to two decimal places.
8. If the input is invalid (e.g., non-numeric, unsupported units), the program should inform the user about the error.
